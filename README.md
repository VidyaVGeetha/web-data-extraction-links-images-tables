Web Scraping and Data Extraction Using Python (IBM Data Analyst Project)
This project demonstrates how to scrape data from web pages using Python, Requests, and BeautifulSoup.
The scraper extracts links, images, and HTML table data, cleans the results, removes duplicates, filters topic-based links (AI, Cloud, Careers), and prepares the output for further data analysis and reporting.
This project was completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst learning program and enhanced further for my data analytics portfolio.
